# 🏍️ Bike-Rental-Prediction Using R By: Mridul Gulati

## 👋🏻 Introduction
This repository contains R scripts for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), building a Random Forest model, and evaluating its performance on a bike rental dataset.

## 🗂️ Files
* R-Assessment-MridulGulati.R: R script for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
* Bike.xlsx: Sample dataset for bike rentals.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Make sure you have R installed on your system. You can download it from [R Studio](https://posit.co/downloads/).
